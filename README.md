# Your Places - MERN Frontend

YourPlaces is a social media application designed for sharing your travel experiences with the world. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along with the CSS for styling, the platform allows for users to sign up or log in, create posts about the places they've visited, and upload photos. It integrates with the Google Maps API for location-based features and uses AWS S3 for persistent image storage. Users can edit their posts, and delete them if needed. The backend securely connects to a MongoDB database, managing both user profiles and individual place details.

This repository contains the frontend portion of the application, built with React and hosted using Firebase Static Hosting.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles securely.
  
- **Create and Manage Posts**: 
  - Users can create posts about places they've visited, including adding images, descriptions, and locations.

- **Google Maps Integration**: 
  - Location-based features powered by Google Maps API, allowing users to pin and view places on a dynamic map.

- **AWS S3 Image Storage**: 
  - Images are uploaded to AWS S3 for persistent storage, ensuring they are retained even after backend redeployments.

- **Edit and Delete Posts**: 
  - Users can update or delete their posts, maintaining control over their content.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Built with responsive design principles using CSS, making the platform accessible on various devices.

- **MongoDB Database**: 
  - The backend is connected to a MongoDB database for secure storage of user data and place details.

    REACT_APP_ASSET_URL=your-asset-url
    ```
    - Replace `your-google-maps-api-key` with your actual Google Maps API key.
    - Replace `your-backend-url` with the URL of your backend (e.g., `http://localhost:5001/api` for local development).
    - Replace `your-asset-url` with the URL for accessing assets.

4. **Run the app locally**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
